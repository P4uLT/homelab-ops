## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Monorepo root skeleton: documentation, ignore policy, task/mise/sops
  placeholders, top-level architecture directories with purpose markers.
- Ansible shell: complete directory topology (inventory, playbooks,
  roles, collections, plugins), `ansible.cfg`, Python toolchain lock
  (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`), lint configs, and a local verification
  contract (`task -d ansible verify`) that needs no managed host.
